# Dog Breed Identification

### Data

The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data), which comprises 120 breeds of dogs
- train.zip: the training set, 10222 dog images
- test.zip: the test set, 10357 dog images
- labels.csv.zip: the labels (dog breeds) for the images in the training set
- sample_submission.csv.zip: a sample submission file in the correct format

### Codes

- [rearrange.py](rearrange.py): copy all the images into branches of directories that can be loaded by sklearn [load_files](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_files.html).
- [get_features.py](get_features.py): obtain the bottleneck features generated by the [InceptionResNetV2](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/inception_resnet_v2.py) model.
- [train_predict.ipynb](train_predict.ipynb): train a neural net against the bottleneck features and the labels; generate predictions for the test set.
